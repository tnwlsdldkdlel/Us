# Todo
- [x] Inspect repository layout and purpose
- [x] Collect workflow commands and guidelines
- [x] Persist onboarding knowledge to memory files

# Plan
1. List key directories and skim entry files for architecture context.
2. Aggregate development workflow commands and style guidance from docs.
3. Capture findings in Serena memories for future use.

# Working
- 16:36 Listed repo root contents to note main directories and docs.
- 16:38 Reviewed `README.md`, `pubspec.yaml`, and core app files (`lib/main.dart`, `lib/app.dart`, `lib/app/auth_gate.dart`).
- 16:42 Captured lint and style settings from `analysis_options.yaml` and user-provided guidelines.
- 16:44 Wrote onboarding memories (`project_overview`, `style_conventions`, `suggested_commands`, `task_completion`).

# Result
- Onboarding complete with summaries stored via Serena memory files for project overview, style, commands, and task completion checklist.
