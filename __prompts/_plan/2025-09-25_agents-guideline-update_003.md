# Overview
- Append response history guidance to agent guidelines in English and Korean docs.

# Plan
1. Review `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS_KO.md` for existing structure.
2. Insert the requested instructions in English and Korean respectively.
3. Re-read both files to confirm language accuracy and formatting.

# Steps
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS_KO.md` to confirm existing mandatory practices wording.
- Added the new instructions to the English guide and mirrored them with a natural Korean translation.
- Reread both documents to ensure formatting and language alignment with project conventions.

# Result
- Agent guidelines in both languages now require Korean-only responses and checking `__prompts` history before seeking clarification.
