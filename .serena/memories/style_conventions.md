# Style & Conventions
- Follow Flutter/Dart defaults with `flutter_lints`; prefer resolving lint warnings rather than ignoring them.
- Indentation uses 2 spaces; files named in snake_case (e.g., `appointment_detail_screen.dart`).
- Classes/widgets: UpperCamelCase; variables/functions: lowerCamelCase.
- Avoid `print`; rely on logging or debugger utilities.
- Respect localization setup (Korean + English) when introducing strings.
- Align with design guidance in `__prompts/_docs/design.md` for colors, typography, and layout.
